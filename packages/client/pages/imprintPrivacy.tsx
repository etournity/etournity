    <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose
      content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability
      for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
      pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The
      linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
      linking. Illegal contents were not identifiable at the time of linking.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not
      reasonable without concrete indications of a legal violation. If we become
      aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Liability for Contents</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      As service providers, we are liable for our own contents of these websites
      according to Paragraph 7, Sect. 1 German Telemedia Act (TMG). However,
      according to Paragraphs 8 to 10 German Telemedia Act (TMG), service
      providers are not obligated to permanently monitor submitted or stored
      information or to search for evidences that indicate illegal activities.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Legal obligations to remove information or to block the use of information
      remain unchallenged. In this case, liability is only possible at the time
      of knowledge about a specific violation of law. Illegal contents will be
      removed immediately once we acquire knowledge of them.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Copyright</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The content and works on these pages created by the site operators are
      subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution, or
      any form of commercialization of such material beyond the scope of the
      copyright law shall require the prior written consent of its respective
      author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are permitted for
      private, non-commercial use only.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the
      copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party
      content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a
      copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become aware
      of any infringements, we will remove such content immediately.
