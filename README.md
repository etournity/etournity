Some of our testers have called it the ‚Äústart.gg killer‚Äù, but you‚Äôre welcome to try that our for yourself on\

# Getting Started

## Requirements

Please ensure you have all of these installed before proceeding:

- [node.js >=12.10](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
- node.js c++ Build Tools\
  windows: `npm install --global windows-build-tools`\
  linux/macOS: `python2.7`, `gcc`, `make`
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [react-developer-tools (optional)](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/09/02/new-react-developer-tools.html#installation)

<br/>

## Installation

First of all, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JulianKarhof/etournity.git && cd etournity
```

Before jumping into the code, there are a couple of thigs we need to ensure:

- Run `yarn` in the root folder

  > This will install all required npm dependencies locally. Every time new dependencies are introduced, this will have to be run again.

- Run `yarn generate` in the root folder
  > This will generate all of the necessary graphql/prisma code and will have to be run again each time the prisma schema is updated

---

**NOTE:** For convenience, we've created a setup script (`yarn setup`) which combines these two together for when you e.g. pull the latest changes from github.

---

- Ensure all environment variables are defined

  > In `packages/server` and `packages/client`, copy the `.env.example` files to `.env`. The default values should `just work‚Ñ¢`

- Have a Postgresql database running

  > For convenience, we provide a docker-compose script to run a seeded postgres database. To start it, run:\
  > `yarn db` or `yarn db:bg` (background - detach from terminal)

  > To stop an instance running in the background, use `yarn db:stop-bg`.

  > To reset the database, run `yarn db:down`.

  > To reseed the database, run `yarn db:reseed`

- Apply the latest database migrations

  > In development mode, this happens automatically.
  > The only thing to remember is that - after you change the database schema, `yarn migrate:save` has to be run to create a new migration file.
  > NOTE: there should only be one migration per Pull-Request max.

<br/>

Now the fun can finally begin!\
Fire up your favourite terminal emulator, run `yarn dev` and everything should be up and runing perfectly.

# Contributing

## Guidelines

Our workflow is based on [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), for more information about the how and why, check out their website.

- We have one main branch, `main`, which is our single source of truth
- `main` is **always** release ready
- All work happens in [short-lived feature-branches](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/short-lived-feature-branches/) (short-lived = no more than 2 days)
- Branch names follow `kebab-case` and have to be prefixed with `feat/`, `refactor/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`, or `release/`\
  Example: `feat/my-awesome-feature`
- Merge-Commits follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary). See [Common Commit Types](./pull_request_template.md).
- All tests need to pass and at least 1 review is required before a Pull Request can be merged
- After a PR has been merged, the branch needs to be deleted (this happens automatically)
